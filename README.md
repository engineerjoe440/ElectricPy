Python Libraries with functions and constants related to electrical engineering.

The functions and constants that make up these modules represent a library of material compiled with the intent of being
used primarily for research, development, education, and exploration in the realm of electrical engineering.

Check out our full documentation: https://electricpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**:warning: Documentation has recently been updated to use [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/)**

GitHub Pages are still active, and will continue to be for the forseeable future, but they're intended for developmental
updates rather than primary documentation.

Collect Repository and Install
    
1. Clone/Download Source Code from GitHub [Repository](https://github.com/engineerjoe440/ElectricPy)
2. Open Terminal and Navigate to Folder with `cd` Commands:
  - `cd <path\to\containing\folder>\electricpy`
3. Use Python to Install Module from `setup.py`:
  - `python setup.py install`
  
### 2) Verify Installation

Check installation success in Python environment

```python
import electricpy
electricpy._version_
```

## To Do List

- Add Heat Sink Solver

## Get Involved / Contribute

If you're interested in contributing, we'd love to see your support in a number of ways!

1. **Write Tests** - We're really lacking in this area. We've recently added simple GitHub actions to test installation, but that's about it. We hope that someday we can test all functions in this module for verification.
2. **Contribute New Electrical Engineering Functions** - If you've got a new function related to electrical engineering that you'd like to see added, we'd love to throw it into this module. Our goal is that this module can become the comprehensive electrical engineering toolkit in Python. Drop us a note, or create a pull request!
3. **Report Issues** - We don't want issues to go unnoticed. Please help us track bugs and resolve them!
4. **Get the Word Out** - This project is still in its infancy, so please share it with your friends and colleagues. We want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to take advantage of this project.
