*Electrical-Engineering-for-Python*

Python functions and constants related to electrical engineering.

The functions and constants that make up these modules represent a library of
material compiled with the intent of being used primarily for research,
development, education, and exploration in the realm of electrical engineering.

The base module for the `electricpy` package, electricpy.py may be leveraged
in any Python script or program by using the *import* command similar to that
shown below.

>>> import electricpy as ep

Filled with calculators, evaluators, and plotting functions, this package will
provide a wide array of capabilities to any electrical engineer.

Built to support operations similar to Numpy and Scipy, this package is designed
to aid in scientific calculations.
